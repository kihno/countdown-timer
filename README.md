Create a 5 minute countdown timer that can be started and stopped.

- When the page is first loaded, the counter displays 5 minutes (i.e. 5:00)
- When the user clicks "Start", the counter starts counting down.
- When the user clicks "Stop", the timer should start elapsing time.
- When the user clicks "Reset", the timer should be reset to 5 minutes again
